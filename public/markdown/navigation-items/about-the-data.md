# Report on existing monitoring platforms and potential data for the integration into ADO  

The Regional report on existing drought monitoring platforms and potential data for the integration into ADO is based on the analysis of channelled reviews of drought monitoring approaches from Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Slovenia.  

The report includes an overview of existing indices by country, by drought type addressed, by type of calculation and type of projection. It collects drought monitoring approaches for early detection of drought conditions across the Alpine region. For the preparation of the future ADO platform it collects information about already existing drought monitoring platforms available to users at country and international level. The report reviews existing platforms and by doing this collects the requirements and examples of good practices for tools of early warning systems. Lastly it collects indices already in use in the Alpine area and recommends additional indices that could be used in the ADO platform.
