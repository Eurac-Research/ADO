## 1. Background & Motivation  
Droughts are an increasing concern in the Alpine region and in the lowland areas that rely on Alpine water supplies.  
The **Alpine Drought Observatory (ADO)** provides a tool for a quick and easy overview of the current drought situation in the Alps, as well as past drought events over the last 40 years of time-series data.

## 2. The ADO Phase (Monitoring)  
### What was done  
ADO integrates data from climate models, satellite observations and ground-station networks across all Alpine countries.  
It harmonises this information and updates it on a regular basis. Users can access **open-data (CC-BY 4.0)** through the web interface, selecting different drought indices (such as SPI, SPEI, SSPI, vegetation indices, hydrological data) to explore drought conditions by region and over time.

### Development & Data-in-Action Initiative
The ADO platform was developed in close collaboration with **Eurac Research's Communication Department** as part of their **[Data-in-Action initiative](https://www.eurac.edu/en/data-in-action)**. Together, we turned years of satellite observations, climate data, and ground measurements into a tool that speaks directly to those who need it — farmers tracking water stress, water managers planning resources, policymakers preparing for climate impacts. Data-in-Action is about making science work for communities, turning research into real-world solutions that help protect the Alps and the people who depend on them.

### Partners & Scope  
The ADO project (2019-2022) brought together a consortium of research institutions and national/regional agencies across the Alpine Space.  
It was applied in six case studies across the Alpine countries, addressing agricultural drought, hydrological drought, and ecosystem impacts.

### Key Outputs  
- A web-platform for drought monitoring across the Alpine Space.  
- An inventory of drought impacts (“EDII-Alps”) documenting more than 3,000 recorded events and impacts.  
- Guidelines for drought risk management and recommendations for governance in mountain regions.

## 3. The A-DROP Phase (Forecasting & Services)  
### Why the next step  
Building on the successful ADO phase, the work is now being advanced and expanded through the new **A-DROP** project (Alpine DROught Prediction) under the **Interreg Alpine Space 2021-2027** programme.  
The focus shifts from primarily monitoring to **forecasting, operational services**, and tailored sectoral solutions.

### What A-DROP does  
- Develops a **multi-sectoral drought forecasting system** that combines the existing ADO monitoring infrastructure with new datasets, prediction tools and tailored services for sectors such as hydropower, agriculture and winter tourism.  
- Involves 11 partners from five Alpine-Space countries — from research institutions to public administrations.  
- Implements real-life pilot studies (in agriculture, hydropower, snow/water management) and regional climate model simulations to estimate future drought conditions.  
- Offers tailored training and outreach events to ensure the transition from research to operational practice and to support water governance.

## 4. What You Can Do / Why It Matters  
Through these two phases—monitoring via **ADO**, and forecasting & services via **A-DROP**—we aim to enhance drought risk management across the Alpine region.  
By moving from **monitoring** (ADO) to **forecasting and operational responses** (A-DROP), we support decision-makers and stakeholders in anticipating, preparing for and adapting to droughts in mountain and downstream regions.

For users this means:  
- Access to open data and drought indicators for the Alpine Space (ADO)  
- Upcoming or developing services, tools and tailored applications for specific sectors (A-DROP)  
- A stronger evidence base (historical impacts, vulnerabilities) and improved capability to plan ahead
