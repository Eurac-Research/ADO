The ADO project is generating a wide array of datasets for monitoring of drought which are all made available under an open data license. All datasets are shared through our [Environmentdal Data Platform](https://edp-portal.eurac.edu/home "EDP-Portal"), which offers a variety of interfaces for accessing the data, including hosted [jupyter environments](https://edp-portal.eurac.edu/jupyter/ "jupyter"), openEO API through the [web editor](https://editor.openeo.org/?server=https://openeo.eurac.edu "openEO web editor") or directly using the python and R client libraries and OGC standards like the WFS and [Web Coverage Service (WCS)](http://saocompute.eurac.edu/rasdaman/ows#/services "rasdaman").
